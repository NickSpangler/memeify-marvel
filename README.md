## Usage

To get started, you can browse all memes and see what other folks have created. Click on the download icon to download your favorite memes, and feel free to share them on social media or with friends. Make sure to give a 'like' to the memes you appreciate!

Navigate to the 'Create Memes' tab to create your own meme. You can click on any image under the Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, and Captain America tabs and it will autofill into the meme template at the top of the page. Remove any image you want from the template by clicking the 'X' in the top right corner. Note that the first empty spot in the template will be the spot filled by your next image selection. Choose whether or not each panel gets its own caption, and optionally give the meme a title. Then click 'Memeify' to create your meme. At any time you can click 'Clear' to reset the entire meme template.
